# Oil-War-and-Wall-Street-Impact-of-the-Russia-Ukraine-Conflict-on-Brent-Crude-and-the-S-P-500
Time-series econometric analysis examining how the Russia–Ukraine war altered the Brent crude oil–S&amp;P 500 relationship, revealing structural breaks, volatility instability, and limits of conventional GARCH modelling during geopolitical crises.

This study investigates how the Russia–Ukraine war reshaped the relationship between Brent crude oil prices and the S&P 500 index between May 2020 and May 2025 using time-series econometric techniques. The analysis applies descriptive statistics, unit root testing, cointegration analysis, and ARCH/GARCH volatility modelling to evaluate structural breaks, volatility clustering, and regime shifts in oil-equity dynamics during a major geopolitical crisis.

The findings reveal that the war introduced a significant structural disruption in the long-run equilibrium between oil and equity markets, with weakened cointegration and unstable volatility behaviour—highlighting the limitations of traditional GARCH models under extreme geopolitical stress and emphasizing the need for adaptive risk-management and modelling approaches.
